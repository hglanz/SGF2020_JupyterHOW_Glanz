    "Whether you're writing text or code, a Jupyter Notebook is composed \"cells\" that each contain either markdown text OR code (but generally not both). Once rendered, it's actually a little hard to tell which pieces of text are in separate cells. For example, this subsection is in a different cell than the small introduction section above.\n",

    "\n",
    "New cells can be created using the menus at the top of the Jupyter interface OR you can use keyboard controls akin to those in vi (or vim). For example, when you're not editing the contents of a cell you can use \"j\" to navigate down the notebook one cell at a time and \"k\" will go up. The \"enter\" key with a particular cell selected will enter edit mode and allow you to change the contents of a cell. You may also just double-click a cell to enter edit mode for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the type of a cell (e.g. markdown or code), you can use the drop-down menu at the top of the notebook. Rendering the markdown in a cell or running the code in a cell is as easy as having that cell selected and hitting **Ctrl+Enter** or **Shift+Enter**."
